Niger, a land-locked country in the western Sahel, is one of the poorest countries in the world and relies primarily on subsistence rain-fed agriculture, a livelihood experiencing increasing stress with a changing climate.</p><p>Niger and the Sahel are subject to recurrent and devastating droughts as well as an increase in the occurrence of floods. Food insecurity and low levels of social and manufactured capital inhibit the population’s resilience to increasingseasonal variation in rainfall, as well as longer-term climatic changes.</p>"
